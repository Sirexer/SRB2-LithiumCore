# SRB2-LithiumCore
LithiumCore is an addon for Sonic Robo Blast 2 (SRB2) designed to improve hosting and server management.

# Addon description 
An add-on for SRB2, consisting of a set of server and client subsystems: account and authorization system (including 2FA/TOTP), progress/configuration saving, flexible menu/interface system (BBCode in MOTD, custom HUD hooks), module/add-on loader, and a bunch of admin tools (banlist, command permissions, console settings, etc.). The add-on contains a large number of graphics/icons and built-in libraries (JSON, QR/TOTP/sha1, etc.).

Everything is written in pure Lua. You only need SRB2 itself to run LithiumCore.
