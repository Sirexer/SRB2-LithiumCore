Lithium Core is still in pre-release state. I do not recommend to distribute it publicly and host it on a public server. It's not forbidden, but it's better not to do it until the official release.

Lithium Core has many features such as MOTD with BB Code formatting; Account System, which allows you to save player progress even if the server has been restarted; has its own menu.
All these features need to be tested. So if you find a bug (even WARNING in the console) then let me know. Do you have any suggestions, add support for your addon? You can easily contact me via Discord (sirexer), also I can be easily found on Discord servers like SRB2.

Special thanks:
ChetTJ for the addon icon;
Ors for the Unicode fonts;
rxi for JSON library.
